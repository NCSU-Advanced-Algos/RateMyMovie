"Toy Story 2","9414","good","This isnt a made-for-video that they decided to put into theaters, but a version intended from the first to be theatrical. Thats important, because it means more detail and complexity went into the animation.",86

"Taxi to the Dark Side","770674670","good","despite the calmly logical way in which it allows its revelations to unfold and accumulate, this is an angry powder-keg of a film, exploding the reactionary myth that under certain circumstances torture can be acceptable, serviceable or even necessary.",88
"Taxi to the Dark Side","770674670","good","Its with Dilawar that the film begins and ends, and its with Dilawar that Alex Gibneys documentary can rest its case%u2014his story speaks with the deepest ache. Dilawars face stares back%u2014a young, bearded man, his eyes wide in fright.",88
"Taxi to the Dark Side","770674670","good","...all the more effective for its lack of hysteria. It isnt a finger-pointing song so much as a lament for the death of character - the quality that permits us to follow our principles despite our fears.",88
