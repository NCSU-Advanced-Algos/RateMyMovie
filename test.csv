"The Goonies","10027","good","Persists as one of the great fables of young adult cinema not merely because its very skilled at what it does, but because it weaves that magic into the minds and hearts of kids that serve as identifiable facets of our universal journey towards maturity."
"The Goonies","10027","good","...true to the camaraderie of boys who have been left alone to roam on their bikes."
"The Goonies","10027","good","classic mid-1980s Spielberg"
"The Goonies","10027","good","An excellent child oriented fantasy adventure in the vein of The Hardy Boys."
"The Goonies","10027","good","A classic 80s action-fantasy -- tweens will love!"
"Willow","10072","good","Willow is medieval mishmash from George Lucas, a sort of 10th-century Star Wars tossed together with a plethora of elements taken from numerous classic fables."
"Willow","10072","good","a forgotten classic that holds a lot of nostalgia"
"Willow","10072","good","Theres a sunny feeling here thats impossible to deny: a warm, inviting tone unseen in more recent fare."
"Willow","10072","good","Nice fantasy adventure, looking pretty dated now, but ably helmed by Ron Howard."
"Willow","10072","good","Magic-filled fantasy adventure for tweens and up."
"Tombstone","12948","good","Too many characters and not enough time in which to deal with them, and action that seems so rushed to get to the end that important scenes are left out."
"Tombstone","12948","good","A lot of care and attention were obviously devoted to selecting locations, designing sets, and grooming handlebar mustaches. Much less attention went to making one believe that any of the events took place circa 1879."
"Tombstone","12948","good","A spectacular and well acted bit of Western cinema and sadly one in an endangered genre species..."
"Tombstone","12948","good","Sports pretty much everything one would want in a Western, and though its not always eminently artful, it is rarely anything less than entertaining. [Blu-ray]"
"Tombstone","12948","good","One of the finest Westerns to come along since the genre decided largely to pack up and ride into the sunset several decades ago."
"Vibes","519042703","average","Gives off dim vibes among critics and the public."
"Vibes","519042703","average","Nobody escapes unscathed from the gimmicky script co-authored by blockbuster comedy writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel."
"Vibes","519042703","average","Vibes is a harmless, painless romp but its an instance of a sincere attempt at screwball comedy that simply got screwed up."
"Vibes","519042703","average","If there were an Academy Award for Most Instantly Forgettable Film, the odds-on early favorite would be Vibes."
"Vibes","519042703","average","Vibes is a low-vibration romantic comedy about two incompatible psychics falling in love on an Ecuadorean treasure hunt, and everything in it seems nine or 10 beats off."
"Man of Steel","770678819","average","...while it doesnt achieve the brilliance of the modern Batman franchise, and while it certainly has a few flaws... the action is undeniably well-done and there are still good character bits throughout."
"Man of Steel","770678819","average","A robotic exercise in moviemaking that will no doubt satisfy the requirements of millions of distracted moviegoers who no longer require absolute engagement to be entertained-and who might, in fact, prefer exactly that."
"Man of Steel","770678819","average","A gritty, realistic story shot by a director whose instincts constantly push him away from grit and realism, and into flash and fantasy."
"Man of Steel","770678819","average","Despite its excessive running time, and slightly meandering narrative, Man of Steel has definitely earned its place amongst recent comic-book adaptations, standing tall in the DC / Marvel cinematic universe."
"Man of Steel","770678819","average","Christliness has always been an element of the Superman myth. But this films near literal insistence upon it becomes absurd since director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer dont dramatize the analogy, they presume it."
"Die Hard","494020502","good","Its an over-the-top spectacle of action violence, and I loved it."
"Die Hard","494020502","good","Provided you dont put too much thought into it and just enjoy the ride, youll have a blast."
"Die Hard","494020502","good","Ultimately, a passable new Die Hard movie is more than anyone of us ever really expected, and that in itself is worth a jolly old Yippee-Ki-Ay."
"Die Hard","494020502","good","Brainless? Sure. Entertaining? Yup."
"Die Hard","494020502","good","Though its mostly entertaining (if overlong), there is a sense that the whole thing has become somewhat rote."
"Raiders of the Lost Ark","23529","good","Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie. I dont have to tell you why its great. You know why its great. Instead, what follows is a list of very personal moments."
"Raiders of the Lost Ark","23529","good","There is a charm and vitality to Raiders of the Ark, which Spielberg later admitted was the first movie where I actually shot the movie without thinking."
"Raiders of the Lost Ark","23529","good","Harrison Ford embodies the persona of Indiana Jones with perfection and paves him as an iconic hero."
"Raiders of the Lost Ark","23529","good","This film is a volcano of creative ideas in full eruption -- the modern high action adventure against which all others must now be measured."
"Raiders of the Lost Ark","23529","good","Hold on tight, because it starts at full throttle and never lets up."
"Ghostbusters","12000","good","Part of the sheer joy of this movie -- aside from the comic timing of Bill Murray -- is the cartoonish crapness of its apparitions and their placid acceptance by the Ghostbusters team."
"Ghostbusters","12000","good","What you realise about Ghostbusters thirty years on is that Bill Murray is a comedy genius."
"Ghostbusters","12000","good","It speaks to its entire audience, without ever seeming to joke over childrens heads in a snide or overly knowing manner."
"Ghostbusters","12000","good","The elastic structure provides ample room for inspired surrealism, yet the looseness never compromises the films tongue-in-cheek love letter to pre-gentrification Manhattan or its piercing satire of Reaganite go-getting ..."
"Ghostbusters","12000","good","Thirty years later, there are still rumblings of making another sequel, but no one would dare suggest a reboot or re-imagining; Ghostbusters is perfect exactly as it is."
"Seven","771354922","good","Youre left wondering if there is such a thing as too much."
"Seven","771354922","good","Yes, Furious Seven is incredible. I spent just about the entire running time either with a huge smile on my face or cackling hysterically. An"
"Seven","771354922","good","It turns out 2011s Fast Five wasnt a turning point for the series, just a wildly entertaining fluke."
"Seven","771354922","good","Furious 7 offers edge-of-the-seat excitement with outlandish action sequences, inventive stunts, hilarious cartoonish moments and even some touching emotion."
"Seven","771354922","good","It is, perhaps, the ultimate proof that a ridiculous movie and a good movie arent mutually exclusive."
"American Pie","17097","average","It works as well as it does because the central cast - equal parts male and female, lest we forget - are all so uniformly endearing."
"American Pie","17097","average","It may not have invented the genre, but it did bring that genre to a whole new generation."
"American Pie","17097","average","A well aimed jab at jock culture full of satisyingly dirty belly laughs."
"American Pie","17097","average","Another giggly gross-out comedy for teenagers, this one somewhat better than most by virtue of a more satisfying ending."
"American Pie","17097","average","Ultra-raunchy sex comedy is a teen fave -- beware."
"Jaws","10288","good","With no superheroes or post-apocalyptic wastelands in sight, the skill behind Jaws becomes even more thrilling to watch unfold. ... Quite literally, Jaws is the original and the best."
"Jaws","10288","good","Its just such a good film."
"Jaws","10288","good","I still find this film pretty terrifying."
"Jaws","10288","good","Enjoyment derived from tension and fear, interspersed with brief breathers to allow nerve-relieving chuckles and smiles."
"Jaws","10288","good","It may be the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made. Even while youre convulsed with laughter youre still apprehensive, because the editing rhythms are very tricky, and the shock images loom up huge, right on top of you."
"Alien","771391074","bad","Its a found footage war movie about soldiers vs. aliens. Basic stuff, but its not boring."
"Alien","771391074","bad","Alien Outpost pales in comparison to District 9. It probably would have worked better as a short."
"Alien","771391074","bad","Plagued by a rickety premise, generic sets and invaders who recall Doctor Whos Cybermen, Alien Outpost jabs its finger at the Iraq War with repetitive obviousness."
"Alien","771391074","bad","The film looks as though the bulk of the budget was reserved for ammo."
"Alien","771391074","bad","Though well-executed, [Alien Outpost is] ultimately overly familiar and predictable."
"American Beauty","12878","good","American Beauty is deeply disturbing, acerbically funny, brilliantly acted, breathtakingly original and highly sophisticated."
"American Beauty","12878","good","A tightly coiled rage seethes beneath the pretty surface of American Beauty, a wickedly funny black comedy directed by newcomer Sam Mendes."
"American Beauty","12878","good","This is Spaceys best performance since he took home an Oscar for The Usual Suspects."
"American Beauty","12878","good","This seriocomic autopsy of middle-class virtue has the capacity to startle and surprise, and a gift for finding grim humor at the heart of tragedy."
"American Beauty","12878","good","This engrossing centrepiece meshes with subplots involving Burnhams dysfunctional family and unbalanced neighbours, in a virtuoso study of isolation, repression and fulfilment. Mendes infuses the lush visuals and lyrical script with dramatic panache."
"Butterfly Effect","12979","good","Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. So very bad."
"Butterfly Effect","12979","good","Its a pretty dumb and utterly pretentious jumbled drama that is never sure what its trying to say, or what in fact it means."
"Butterfly Effect","12979","good","Tries hard to be affecting and mind-blowing, and sometimes it comes close."
"Butterfly Effect","12979","good","More like The Gag Reflex."
"Butterfly Effect","12979","good","this is exactly the sort of movie I like to see."
"Machine Gun Preacher","771237853","average","it can be a bit... preachy, if you pardon the pun"
"Machine Gun Preacher","771237853","average","With an exploitation-friendly title like Machine Gun Preacher youd think this movie would be the soul brother of Hobo With A Shotgun. Unfortunately, that is not so."
"Machine Gun Preacher","771237853","average","Despite a competent performance from Butler, Machine Gun Preacher tackles way too much material to present a cohesive onscreen telling of the Sam Childers story."
"Machine Gun Preacher","771237853","average","Its an uncomfortable marriage of sentimental genre conventions and real-life tragedy shown with graphic detail. It does bring you inside the main characters internal struggle, but doesnt seem focused enough as it sways into action film territory."
"Machine Gun Preacher","771237853","average","Were given surprisingly little food for thought when it comes to the question of the complicated tensions between Christian faith and violence."
"Machete","770672158","average","Though it starts off well, Machete becomes boring and slow towards the end as Trejos shtick starts to feel a bit stale. Still, youll definitely find some entertainment here."
"Machete","770672158","average","First and foremost, this is a badass action film, with not only ever-badass Trejo doing ever-badass things, but everyone in the cast gets their badass moment."
"Machete","770672158","average","Machete is the coolest revenge-driven, gore-splattered, star-studded Mexploitation flick ever!"
"Machete","770672158","average","Basically what we have here is a very silly exploitation film similar to what Rodriguez did with his half of Grindhouse."
"Machete","770672158","average","The end result is a disastrous waste of time that is as tedious as it is misguided..."
"Revoler","120401269","bad","Revolver taps into a struggle everyone faces that only a small few have been able to relate to. Its not that this film isnt a mess, but that mountain of a mess is on top of a shiny gem of a film that is worthy of being admired."
"Revoler","120401269","bad","An unwieldy, short-circuiting film, packing more tricks than a clowns pocket yet imbued with brute spiritual force"
"Revoler","120401269","bad","Jesus, this is a stupid movie."
"Revoler","120401269","bad","[A]bout as compelling a brief for Kabbalah as Battlefield Earth was for scientology."
"Revoler","120401269","bad","Its not worth the bother."
"Troy","12890","average","An adaptation of The Iliad that would have had to work much harder to miss the point of The Iliad any more thoroughly."
"Troy","12890","average","Violent, watered-down version of The Iliad."
"Troy","12890","average","While an achievement in visuals, Troy fails in every other aspect including its writing and storytelling."
"Troy","12890","average","Despite its shortcomings, Troy is a visual smorgasbord."
"Troy","12890","average","The face-off between Achilles and Hector is beautifully realized, all the more wounding because we can precisely read each mans emotions going into the fight."
"John Carter","770801433","average","Even if Edgar Rice Burroughs 11-volume series is adapted by its three screenwriters into a nonsensical mess, then it should at least be a visual feast, right? Hardly."
"John Carter","770801433","average","This wannabe epic is forgettable, bland and way too long."
"John Carter","770801433","average","They should have just let their freak flag fly and said, To hell with it, heres 100 minutes of John Carter punching aliens."
"John Carter","770801433","average","John Carter is certainly an interesting idea for a film, with a power struggle on an alien world and an outsider affecting the balance, but sadly it never ends up fully working."
"John Carter","770801433","average","If Cecil B. DeMille were alive today and given the chance to direct a special effects-laden fantasy adventure on Mars, he might have made something similar to Andrew Stantons visually stunning epic John Carter."
"Movie 43","771223474","bad","Heres a movie thats way, way, more interesting for the story behind it than for anything that actually happens on screen"
"Movie 43","771223474","bad","The greatest waste of A-list talent since Garry Marshall made his last film."
"Movie 43","771223474","bad","Its got some clever sketches, though to really enjoy them, one must have the sense of humor of a 12-year-old boy. Fortunately, I do."
"Movie 43","771223474","bad","It feels like somebody strung together some of the worst SNL skits and called it a film."
"Movie 43","771223474","bad","a bad idea handled in a hackneyed manner."
"Basic Instinct","16318","average","Joe Eszterhas shamelessly reworks ideas and themes he had earlier exploited in films such as Jagged Edge and Music Box, but the sheer overheated nature of Verhoevens direction makes this extremely watchable."
"Basic Instinct","16318","average","Flashy, raunchy and schlocky, Basic Instinct is classic nineties noir for which Verhoevens overblown direction and Stones exposure secured a place in movie history."
"Basic Instinct","16318","average","The result may be flimsy, but it goes out and grabs you from the start."
"Basic Instinct","16318","average","Trailer trash Hitchcock spliced with overboiled film noir."
"Basic Instinct","16318","average","Verhoeven does not explore the dark side, but merely exploits it, and that makes all the difference in the world."
"The Last Airbender","770805417","bad","There isnt a single convincing performance in the picture, and the badness of the acting is, bizarrely, pretty much in direct proportion to a characters importance."
"The Last Airbender","770805417","bad","The Last Airbender is not just a flop, its a big-budget flop, and its a throwback to that grand old genre, the movie thats so bad that its bad."
"The Last Airbender","770805417","bad","[A] breathtakingly clueless, misconceived, stupid, humourless, unexciting, dim, dumb farrago, the worst film Ive seen in years."
"The Last Airbender","770805417","bad","A quite breathtakingly inept hodge-podge of vapid spirituality, playground chopsocky and visual effects that take 3D to an entirely new level: Zero-D."
"The Last Airbender","770805417","bad","Would it be more accurate to call this The Last Shyamalan Movie?"
"Jack and Jill","771205893","bad","Relentlessly witless."
"Jack and Jill","771205893","bad","Hasnt Al Pacino heard Adam Sandler Sucks before now?"
"Jack and Jill","771205893","bad","Jack and Jill is an ill-advised, too long Saturday Night Live skit gone wrong. Its a cartoon. Its a way for all involved to pad their pockets and a way for Sandler to keep his friends employed."
"Jack and Jill","771205893","bad","Jack and Jills lack of energy disguises contempt, but here [Sandlers] working through his issues in a more compelling way than usual."
"Jack and Jill","771205893","bad","...another complete and total misfire from the once-reliable Adam Sandler..."
"Saving Christmas","771388398","bad","Actor encourages grumpy Christians to embrace the season."
"Saving Christmas","771388398","bad","Hot cocoa is referenced no fewer than nine times. Cameron talks about the drink as though it were the trump card of his entire argument, as though dropping a microphone. And COCOA!"
"Saving Christmas","771388398","bad","It is The Room of Christmas movies. Actually, The Room is more enjoyable. But you get the idea."
"Saving Christmas","771388398","bad","Had Saving Christmas run any longer, Cameron would no doubt have found a way to find the divinity in Frosty, Rudolph, the Grinch, peppermint bark, the Elf on the Shelf, frosted cranberry hand soap and Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo."
"Saving Christmas","771388398","bad","Camerons preferred tool of engagement is a prybar, applied to your eyelids with an indelicate hand."
"Police Story","337730597","good","The likeable and graceful Chan directs, sings and performs jaw-dropping stunts. Few of his American or Austrian rivals attempt a fraction of that."
"Police Story","337730597","good","Algumas das gags (como a confusao com os telefones) caem no vazio, mas as sequencias de acao, como sempre esperamos de Chan, sao formidaveis."
"Police Story","337730597","good","Primo Jackie--excitement and laughs aplenty."
"Police Story","337730597","good","In the course of the story, about drug traffickers, Mr. Chan gets three separate birthday cakes thrown into his face, and participates in several elaborately staged gun fights and car chases."
"Police Story","337730597","good","Solid Jackie Chan. More stunts than martial arts, but still cool."
"The Tuxedo","11896","bad","A cute idea, miserably executed."
"The Tuxedo","11896","bad","Chan often looks as tired as the script, and as bored as the viewing audience."
"The Tuxedo","11896","bad","Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker? Great. Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson? Cool. Jackie Chan and... Jennifer Love Hewitt? What the f**k?"
"The Tuxedo","11896","bad","The Tuxedo is sort of like a film that might have been made from a song by Burt Bacharach; its central conceit is odd, implausible, even a bit silly, but one can hardly begrudge it those elements when the thing plays so beautifully."
"The Tuxedo","11896","bad","... The Tuxedo is an amusing diversion."
"Gigli","14785","bad","The two stars may be in love in real life, but theyve managed to keep that chemistry well-hidden on screen."
"Gigli","14785","bad","It comes to something when a movie is only worth watching to validate just how dreadful it is."
"Gigli","14785","bad","This misguided romantic comedy goes wrong so often and in such profoundly lunkheaded ways that to say it stinks would be bordering on polite understatement."
"Gigli","14785","bad","After the schadenfreudian thrill of watching beautiful people humiliate themselves wears off, it has the same annihilating effect on your will to live."
"Gigli","14785","bad","Nothing in Gigli is sustained, from pace to plot points to character functions. It appears to have been chopped up and put back together again more than once."
